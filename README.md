<h3>What are autoencoders?</h3>

"Autoencoding" is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are :
> * Autoencoders are data-specific, which means that they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on.
> * Autoencoders are lossy, which means that the decompressed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs.
> * Autoencoders are learned automatically from data examples, which is a useful property: it means that it is easy to train specialized instances of the algorithm that will perform well on a specific type of input.
